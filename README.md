# twitter-api fastapi
This project is an academic exercise coded in the course for learning FastAPI<br />
The api is though to be a twitter-like api with some of the functionalities like signing up a new user, logining in a registered user, and a basic CRUD for tweets.<br />
<br />
This exercise does not include a connection to database, instead it uses a .json file where the api will save the information.<br />
In the future, the api will be updated and will have a conection to a database (possibly PostgreSQL or MongoDB).
